# What-Happens-in-Extreme-Cases
Analysis that provides an estimation of the probability of a rare event occurring

In this project we will be analyzing the behavior of two different random variables extracted two datasets cointaining populations of various cities and weight of a set of people. We will be focusing on the distribution of the sum, the applicability of central limit theorem, and above all on the extreme value distribution (statistics of maxima).

Extreme value distribution (EVD) analysis is a statistical method that plays a crucial role in various fields, including finance, hydrogeology, environmental science, and more. Understanding and analyzing extreme values is essential as they often represent rare but impactful events that can have far-reaching consequences.

In other words, we seek models for the behavior of extremes because these models helps us to make risk-informed decisions and investments.
